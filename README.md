# 🍳 CookStack 

CookStack is a JavaFX/Java app that helps you organize, save, and explore all your favorite recipes!


Here’s what’s cooking for future versions of CookStack:   
- **Recipe Sharing** – Find a way to share your recipes with friends and family!  
- **Recipe Images** – Add a picture to every recipe!

---

I've included a **sample save file** so you can jump right in and test it out! All recipes are from allrecipes.com!
```
demo/demo.ser
```

There’s also a **walkthrough video** on youtube!
