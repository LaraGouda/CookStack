## 🏆 Demo

I've included a **sample save file** so you can jump right in and test it out! All recipes are from allrecipes.com!

```
demo/demo.ser
```

🎥 There’s also a **walkthrough video** that shows the app in action — check it out in the `demo/` folder!  

> ⚠️ Heads up! Serialized files are tied to the exact class/package setup. Changing package names might break old files.
